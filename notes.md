# Notes:

#### Non-fantasy related
- Donte Divincenzo -> elite roleplayer? 90th percentile VORP but by far lowest stat producer. 
- Vanvleet is also sick in terms of VORP
- Jarrett Allen? 90th percentile in both VORP and WS/48. 
- Jimmy elite in advanced stats... but box score stats not so much? 73rd in avg fantasy points per min. 

Players 90th quantile in VORP, WS/48, BPM:
- Embiid
- Jokic
- Luka
- Shai
- Giannis
- Haliburton
- AD
- Sabonis
- Kawhi
- Tatum
- Brunson
- Jimmy


### Fantasy related:
- Jimmy? seems fishy with low fpoints per minute (73rd) and lack of availability. 
- BPM/VORP most correlated to fantasy points of advanced stats.


Players who posted elite per minute fantasy numbers but have limited role (with permin rank and pergame rank):

- Day'ron Sharpe (39 227)
- Jonathan Isaac (35 212)
- Goga Bitadze (71 236)
- Trayce Jackson-Davis (32 194) 
- Jalen Smith (34 187)
- TJ Mcconnell (10 134)
- Paul Reed (76 164)
- Tari Eason (43 131)

Do any of these players have a path to a larger role this season? Would look into TJD & keep an eye on Sharpe. Otherwise not really. 

Same thing - but min 25 MPG and 35 GP:

- Josh Giddey (52 107)
- Jusuf Nurkic (29 71)
- Isaiah Hartenstein (59 110)
- Clint Capela (36 85)
- Myles Turner (27 66)
- Collin Sexton (44 79)
- Khris Middleton (45 77)
- Kristaps Porzingis (12 36)
- Chet Holmgren (16 38)
- Evan Mobley (28 43)

Lots of bigs as they rack up rebounds and defensive stats in less play time. Once again this is role-dependent but I could see an increase for Chet and Mobley this year. Porzingis is appealing but the injury risk is ridiculous. Nurkic and Myles Turner could be good picks. Guards in these rankings could be very appealing given a bigger role (Sexton and Giddey). Most of these are upside swings. 

Opposite - players who rely on large workload (still min 25 MPG and 35 GP):
- Coby White (118 69)
- Miles Bridges (98 55)
- Mikal Bridges (113 72)
- Demar Derozan (71 30)
- Jerami Grant (119 85)
- OG Anunoby (133 100)
- Josh Hart (149 117)
- Julius Randle (72 41)
- Fred Vanvleet (48 22)
- Paolo Banchero (73 47)
- Nikola Vucevic (65 44)

DO NOT just look right at these and dismiss these players. Some of these more minute reliant players are safe as WILL continue to get a very large amount of playing time. Especially any player on the New York Knicks (which is about half this list). Guys I would be concerned about on this list are Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant, and Nikola Vucevic. These players are either on developing teams with lots (and more important) mouths to feed, or have moved to a much better team with far less usage potential (Mikal). 

Notes on usage (high usage guys): 
- Lamelo -> third highest usage... if healthy could be elite.
- Donovan Mitchell 31% usage. Will this continue with new coach?
- Cam Thomas 30.5% usage. This if anything will go up this year. Just absolutely useless in every other category. 
- JJJ had 30% usage last year. Will cause significant decrease (LOOK INTO THIS). 
- Bane also had high usage - but he thrives as lower usage player as well so this may be okay. 
- Randle and Brunson both ~> 30% usage. Would avoid all other Knicks. 
- Scoot had 

Low usage guys:
- Podz only 15% usage rate. Like this to increase this year with the loss of klay and his development (Kerr loves him)
- Lots of centers/role players. To be honest not much in terms of possible increases near the bottom.
