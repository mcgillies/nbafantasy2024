## Fantasy Targets:

- Strategy: Take mostly reliable players in early rounds - shoot later. 
-> Max 2 "injury prone" players in first ~8 rounds. eg. Lamelo, Embiid, Porzingis, Jimmy. I call very few players injury prone as it is random chance most of the time. 

- DO NOT FULLY COMMIT TO PLAN: need to still be flexible... if players fall or you are in a positional bind. This is why i give many options. 

- Top 5 pick is a significant advantage in my experience. Not just because there is a set top 5, just how other picks fall in line. Range from ~40-50 ESPN rank is EXTREMELY dry - start reaching here. 

**Round 1 (1-10)**
- 1 - Wemby (slightly biased but cannot pass up the chance this guy average 70 Fpts per game)
- 2 - Jokic
- 3 - Luka
- 4 - Shai
- 5 - Giannis

- After that AD for upside, Ant/Hali safer

**Round 2 (11-20)**
- Early 2nd: Trae, Brunson, Tatum
- Late 2nd: Take a shot on Lamelo or Harden depending on 1st round pick. Lamelo if "safe" first rounder, Harden if not

**Round 3 (21-30)**
- If Lamelo or Harden available TAKE them. 
- Mid 3rd: Sengun, Maxey, KAT if drops
- Late 3rd: Curry, Kyrie (upside), Bam (safe), Chet

**Round 4 (31-40)**
- Kyrie still around for upside.. 
- Mid-Late 4th: Jaylen Brown, Jalen Williams, Lauri, Zion (upside)

**Round 5 & 6 (41-60)**
- Early if can get one of these: Jaylen Brown, Jalen Williams, Lauri, Zion
- Otherwise this is where to start reaching a bit for these two rounds
- Possible players: Vanvleet, Mobley, Garland, Franz, Jalen Johnson (upside), Quickley (upside), Jarrett Allen, Derrick White, JJJ (?)
- My best values: Vanvleet, Cavaliers

**Round 7 & 8 (61-80)**
- If you can get any guys mentioned in rounds 5 & 6 DO. 
- Would be willing to reach: Cam Thomas (upside), Herro, Jimmy (risk), Giddey (upside), Sexton, Tobias Harris, 
- Happy to take at about rank: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Brandon Miller, Rozier
- You are insane: Porzingis
- For end of this range: Keegan Murray, Hartenstein, Nurkic, Barrett, Hart

**Round 9 & 10 (81-100)**
- Would take: Keegan Murray, Hartenstein, Nurkic, Barrett, Hart
- Happy to take at about rank: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Rozier , Beal, , Amen Thompson, Kuminga (will probably go too high)
- If Porzingis drops... (maybe)
- Vassell as well -> this is the range I would start looking to take injured guys. 
- Mark Williams (oh god)
- Possible Reaches: Jabari Smith Jr., Naz Reid, Walker Kessler, Avdija

**Rounds 11-13 (101-130)**
- Keyonte George is ranked 177
- My top shots: Scoot, Sharpe, Sarr
- Here we go. Now forget the rankings. Would take 1-2 shots here depending on how rest of draft played out. 
- I like: Jabari, Kessler, Naz, Zubac, Podz, 
- Safer options: Chris Paul (will get hurt), Herb Jones, Conley, Ayton?
- Who knows: Olynyk (if minutes), Draymond, Ausar, Sochan, Marcus Smart, 
- Probably dropped in two weeks but f it upside: Wiggins, Ben Simmons (oh god), Lonzo (lol), KPJ (ew)


**Rookies**
Basically do not like any of them - Sarr has upside but could be the worst player to grace earth. Otherwise eh.
